# A-Mini-Database-Project-for-the-University-of-Jordan-Hospital-System

## Problem Definition:
Our project is a database system that includes the overall management system of Jordan University Hospital, including their medical units, medical Departments, patients and staff info as well. 
The reason of why we chose this problem is because of the importance of hospitals role in our lives, and because it is an interesting problem. People who will care about our mini project are the doctors, hospital management staff, and obviously the patients since this group of people will benefit from it.
